// ADMIN VERIFICATION WORKFLOW GUIDE
//
// Since you partner with a community of café owners for manual validation,
// the admin verification process is simplified to Firebase manual updates.
//
// CURRENT SYSTEM:
// - Shops have an "isVerified" boolean field (default: false)
// - Only verified shops appear in discovery, maps, and recommendations
// - Unverified shops appear to owners in their business dashboard
//
// MANUAL APPROVAL PROCESS:
//
// 1. RECEIVE CAFÉ LIST
//    - Café owners from your community provide lists of legitimate cafés
//    - You compile these into a validation list
//
// 2. VERIFY IN FIREBASE:
//    a. Go to Cloud Firestore Console
//    b. Open the "shops" collection
//    c. For each café to approve:
//       - Find the shop document by name (you can search/filter)
//       - Open the document
//       - Look for the "isVerified" field
//       - If it doesn't exist, add it with value: true (boolean)
//       - If it exists and is false, set it to: true
//       - Optionally add "verifiedAt" timestamp
//       - Optionally add "verifiedBy" field with admin name
//
// 3. BATCH OPERATIONS (for multiple shops):
//    If you need to approve many at once, consider:
//    - Using Firebase CLI with a script
//    - Running a batch operation through Firebase Functions
//    - Contact Firebase support for assistance
//
// 4. TRACKING VERIFICATIONS:
//    Add these optional fields to track approvals:
//    {
//      "isVerified": true,
//      "verifiedAt": Timestamp.now(),
//      "verifiedBy": "admin-name",
//      "verificationNotes": "Approved by community validation"
//    }
//
// REJECTION PROCESS:
// - Keep "isVerified" as false
// - Optionally add "rejectionReason" field explaining why
// - Shop owners won't see their shop in public listings
// - You can contact them to provide more information
//
// IN-APP DISPLAY:
// - Verified badge (checkmark icon) shows on verified shops
// - Pending/unverified shops show warning icon
// - Only verified shops appear in:
//   * Explore tab shop listings
//   * Map view
//   * Featured cafés section
//   * Recommendations and notifications
//
// FUTURE ENHANCEMENT:
// To implement an in-app admin dashboard in the future:
// 1. Create "admins" user role
// 2. Add admin management screen in app
// 3. Display unverified shops awaiting approval
// 4. Allow in-app approval/rejection with notes
// 5. Add notification when café owners submit new shops
//
// For now, the manual Firebase approach is faster and gives you
// full control over the community validation process.
