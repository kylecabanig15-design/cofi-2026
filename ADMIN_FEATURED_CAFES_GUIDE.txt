// ADMIN GUIDE: Setting Featured Cafés Manually
//
// Since you'll be manually selecting featured cafés from your community partners,
// follow these steps in Firebase Console:
//
// 1. Go to Cloud Firestore Console
// 2. Open the "shops" collection
// 3. For each café you want to feature:
//    - Click to open the shop document
//    - Look for the "isFeatured" field (create it if missing)
//    - Set "isFeatured" to "true" (boolean)
//    - Optionally add "featuredAt" timestamp (Timestamp type)
//
// 4. The app will automatically show shops with isFeatured = true 
//    in the "Monthly Featured Cafe Shops" section, sorted by:
//    - Rating (highest first)
//    - Then by review count (highest first)
//
// To remove a café from featured:
//    - Set "isFeatured" to "false" in that shop's document
//
// Tips for Easy Selection:
// - Create a database index on shops collection:
//  Fields: isFeatured (Ascending) + ratings (Descending)
// - Filter your view by adding: isFeatured = true
//  to easily see and manage all featured shops
//
// The "Monthly Featured Cafe Shops" label is currently shown for all featured
// shops. You can manually rotate them on a monthly basis by toggling the
// isFeatured field when updating your selection.
